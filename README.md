# MyLib API


### Description
MyLib API is a project built using Spring Boot and Java technologies. The project aims to provide a library management system that can be used to manage books, authors, publishers, and library members. This API offers various features such as user registration and authentication, book search and management, book borrowing and returning, as well as author, publisher, and member data management.

The main features of the API Library include:
- Authentication and Authorization: This API provides user authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only users with appropriate access rights can perform certain operations within the system.
- Book Management: Users can add, delete, update, search, and view information about books available in the library.
- Author and Publisher Management: The API allows users to add, delete, update, search, and view information about authors and publishers of registered books in the system.
- Book Borrowing and Returning: Users can process book borrowing and returning, as well as view the borrowing history of books performed by library members.

The API Library is designed with a structured architecture and implemented with RESTful API standards that allow easy integration with client applications. This project can serve as a strong foundation for the development of further library applications or related projects.
